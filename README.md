# New TS Boilerplate

## TODO List

- [x] add and configure react navigation
- [x] add a simple authentication flow
- [x] persist authentication data
- [ ] configure absolut import
- [ ] add a bottom navigator for the authenticated screens
- [x] install and configure redux
- [x] add redux thunk
- [x] move the authentication logic to redux
- [ ] install and configure correctly styled-components _(w/ ts particularities)_
- [ ] decide the relevance of adding a logger _(spike out about redux-logger and reactotron)_
- [ ] **whether there's no more important things to add**, deploy it as a boilerplate
